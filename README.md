# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

Heart Disease (including Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Stroke) remains one of the top causes of death in the US. The Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics—2019 Update from the American Heart Association indicates that:

- 116.4 million, or 46% of US adults are estimated to have hypertension. These are findings related to the new 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines.
- On average, someone dies of Cardiovascular disease(CVD) every 38 seconds—about 2,303 deaths from CVD each day, based on 2016 data.
- On average, someone dies of a stroke every 3.70 minutes—about 389.4 deaths from stroke each day, based on 2016 data.

In this project, I will unleash useful insights using heart disease datasets and build a stacked ensemble model by combining the power of best-performing machine learning algorithms.
